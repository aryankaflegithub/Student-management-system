# Student-management-system

It is created by using basic c++ language. It consists of basic functions and loops. 
it consists of six functions 
enter , show  , search , update ,  delete ,  exit 
as delete is already defined in the iostream header file it cannot be used, so we instead used deletedata 
there are 6 arrays for 
first name , 
last name , 
rollno , 
facalty , 
class , 
contact 
there is a global variable total that counts the total no of data input 

Enter function -> 
it takes data from the user 
the user can give as many data as they want at once 
or can repeat this process as many times as they want 

show function -> 
shows all the data  

search function -> 
shows the data of a selected student with the help of rollno 

update function -> 
give it a rollno and it will allow you  to change the data of that student 

delete function -> 
two options are provided 
1st deletes every thing 
2nd deletes selected rollno data 

exit function ->    
it just does nothing and ends the code
